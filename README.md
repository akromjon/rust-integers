Integers in Rust:

Rust supports the following integers with different sizes:
  - signed integers: both positive and negative numbers
  - unsigned: only positive numbers starting from 0

Syntax:
- signed ints: <code>i8,i16,i32,i64,i128</code>
- unsigned ints: <code>u8,u16,u32,u64,u128</code>

Note: when an integer variable is declared without its type, <code>i32</code> will be used as a default;
